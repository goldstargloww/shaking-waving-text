hey! so i've been helping to work on the [isat script project](https://github.com/felikatze/isat-script-project), and though we haven't implemented it on the actual thing, i wanted to figure out how to emulate isat's shaking and waving text in html and css.

i saw [oatmealine](https://oat.zone)'s [markdown plus](https://oat.zone/markdown-plus) and how it did that, so the code for this is partially inspired by that :>

[here](https://goldstargloww.github.io/shaking-waving-text/)'s what it looks like!
![a gif screen recording of an example of the shaking and waving text. the shaking text reads "okay here's just a bunch of shaking text so you can see a lot of it at once. it's incredibly painful to look at in the code, because literally every non-space character has to be wrapped in its own span, but i made a quick python thing to do it for you, so it's only really a problem when reading the code". the waving text reads "alright now here's some waving text. you can change the wavelength in the css :> this is also painful on the literally every character has a span front but it's fiiiine"](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a1c9c32-dc83-459b-bea8-2931b59a425a)
