# readme

hey! so i've been helping to work on the [isat script project](https://github.com/felikatze/isat-script-project), and though we haven't implemented it on the actual thing, i wanted to figure out how to emulate isat's shaking and waving text in html and css.

i saw [oatmealine](https://oat.zone)'s [markdown plus](https://oat.zone/markdown-plus) and how it did that, so the code for this is partially inspired by that :>
